### Content

- `labeled_instances.csv`: contains the valid instances used to build the categorization. Each instance comes with the assigned label(s), its category (commit/issue/PR) and the link to open the instance on GitHub.
- `discarded_instances.csv`: contains the instances discarded during the manual analysis. Each instance comes with its category (commit/issue/PR) and the link to open the instance on GitHub.
- `conflicts_info.csv`: contains information about conflicts by reviewers when labeling instances, which is used to calculate Cohen's kappa coefficient. In particular, for each instance and for each reviewer we report whether they have discarded or labeled the instance.
- `labels.csv`: contains the labels that make up the categorization. Each label comes with the number of instances (commit/issue/PR) tagged with it and their ids. Note that if an instance is tagged with the label _"documentation -> improving writing"_ the instance will appear in both the father label _"documentation"_ and the child label _"documentation -> improving writing"_.
- `ngram_analysis.txt`: contains the list of n-grams used to select the instances to analyz from the initial dataset.
- `cohen_k.r`: is the R script used to calculate the Cohen's kappa coefficient.
- `categorizatio.png`: is the representation of the categorization built on top of the manual analysis (see it also below).
